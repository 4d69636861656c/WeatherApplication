# Weather Forecast Application 

An application developed in C# that takes advantage of OpenWeatherMap's freely available online API. The service allows you to regularly download current weather and forecast data in JSON format. 

## Usage 
### Get a token 
First of all, you should get a token from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), as I did not include one in this project. 
### Copy and paste your key 
Open the project in your preferred code editor and place your key into the view model class and run the program. That's all. If the key is valid, the program will now run and display weather data. 

## Description 
### Pattern used 
This project is written in C# and uses the MVVM pattern. You can find the idea behind this pattern here: [MVVM Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel).
